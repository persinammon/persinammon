### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ my name is Monica

- ðŸ”Ž Iâ€™m currently searching for my next home as a software engineer. To showcase my technical skills and out of a desire to deepen my knowledge, I've been completing personal projects. Many are Udacity projects, so I don't go build blindly and re-invent the wheel. I usually added something extra on top of the original project spec though.<br />

    Since I've started, I've covered C++, Java 8+ features including the Streams API/functional programming in Java, concurrency, design patterns, Mockito/JUnit/Jackson/Guice, full-stack development in Express.js and Flask with Docker files, a Chrome extension I came up with using TypeScript. In my next round, I plan on filling out fundamental CS projects like a compiler and database using MOOCs from Stanford and UC Berkeley.<br />

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on open-source contributions to Julia lang.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/her/hers
- âš¡ Fun fact: It's possible to read articles from some (one) news site for free by disabling JavaScript to get past the paywall...Another fun one is `import this` in the Python REPL for The Zen of Python.....
<br /><br />
I have some blog-like posts in this repo. I also have a personal about me site I made solely for fun.
