Can we quit it with the "How I got into FAANG with 250 LC or Became a Super Smart MLE and Let Me Teach It To the Masses"
and actually spend some time reflecting on the greats and baby greats?

At least Cory is really feeling it.

It's not really about me, but these usually are the same people picking out stuff about my gender and attacking my aptitude, lol

We live in an unprecedented time, where we have so much information online, social choices, and rapid advances in cultural change-
it can motivate and amplify people's positive and negative choices. I've seen people learn how to manipulate others in reddit subforums, share college admission stats, how to write a tech resume, seek therapy, find new artists....it's an advantage where it's possible to 
be exposed to better things than you could've possibly found on your own, and it teaches everyone skills like networking just by being able
to internet search for information. It's a disadvantage where you can lose your sense of true creativity, deep work, what brings you joy in life,
honesty in sharing both your highs/lows/messy and ugly stages, if you aren't always thinking and reflecting on it or if you're always choosing to think
on how to get ahead. If you never read a book and truly feel and reflect for the characters, you're missing out on a skill that's not findable on Google ever

When Aaron wrote this web standard RSS stuff (as a 14 year old....), the Internet was messy. Forums came and went. Programming O'Reilly and For Dummies books were
all over the library and Borders, and Borders/Redbox/everything were put out of business by scrappy tech giants. Trends on trends in physical life
and now in the collective social mediascape. It's unbelievable that no one seems to be tracking any of this, or are putting down younger, messier versions of themselves
like it's a bad thing. Creativity is messy. Creativity can look like nothing for a long time. Honesty can look plain and unattractive, but not pretending to be perfect
does mean you have integrity. webarchive everything that was there before, ten thousand births and deaths of [ozymandias](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46565/ozymandias). 
Where is the boundless optimism and simplicity of believing in something weird?

I'm not a hundred percent on board with Aaron's particular set of gumptions, interests, choice of eschewing 1/2-3/4 of school, but he's a hometown hero just as much as the 
tech and music billionaires who did it and managed to get away with it. Attacking messiness and simplicity is the same as attacking creativity and integrity is the same 
as attacking what started the Internet boom which ushered in a new era of pretending to not be messy and simple to begin with
